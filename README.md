A part of my move away from centralized propritery companies to open source and decentralized networks, I now use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) as my git service. Unlike GitHub, it's completely open source and values open source projects. In fact, only open source projects are allowed there. I suggest you read this article: https://giveupgithub.org
